This is a command line utility to control the Pioneer N-70AE streamer using the
Onkyo ISCP protocol which by default uses TCP port 60128.

It may work with other Pioneer or Onkyo networked equipment but some 
functionality (eg DAB or CD control) will not be directly available via pionctl 
commands in which case you will have to enter the ISCP protocol commands 
directly at the pionctl command line (anything starting with a capital letter 
is treated as an ISCP command) and the resulting reply may not be parsed. I 
suggest you download the Onkyo excel spreadsheet (there are quite a few 
versions) that lists these commands. Conversely some pionctl commands may not
be relevant to your system, eg: tunein, airplay.

Some of this client may appear a bit rough and ready but it was never intended
for public release though in the end I decided why not when I chose to use
gitlab as a cloud backup. Anyway, if you think something may be a bit buggy
then it probably is and please email me about it.

The client should connect automatically to the streamer but if not you can
use the -a command line option to set the IP address manually.

On the command line type "help" or just "?" to get a list of commands. The rest
you'll have to work out for yourself as I haven't got around to any 
documentation though to navigate the menus use "up","dn","ex" for exit and "en"
for enter and macros can be run multiple times by putting a number in front 
eg "2 dn". See the macros for more command examples.

I retain the copyright to this code but feel free to use and modify it however
you see fit so long as my original copyright message remains.
