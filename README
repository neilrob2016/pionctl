This is a command line utility to control the Pioneer N-70AE streamer using the
Onkyo ISCP protocol which by default uses TCP port 60128.

It may work with other Pioneer or Onkyo networked equipment but some 
functionality (eg DAB or CD control) will not be directly available via pionctl 
commands in which case you will have to enter the ISCP protocol commands 
directly at the pionctl command line (anything starting with a capital letter 
is treated as an ISCP command) and the resulting reply may not be parsed. I 
suggest you download the Onkyo excel spreadsheet (there are quite a few 
versions) that lists these commands. Conversely some pionctl commands may not
be relevant to your system, eg: tunein, airplay.

The client should connect automatically to the streamer but if not you can
use the -a command line option to set the IP address manually.

Commands are divided into client (local) commands and streamer commands. Most
of the streamer commands are a 1 -> 1 mapping of raw ISCP commands whereas
some of the client commands - eg show, macro, toggle - have multiple sub
options.

On the command line type "help" or just "?" to get a list of commands but the 
rest you'll have to work out for yourself as I haven't got around to any 
documentation however to navigate the streamer menus use "up","dn","ex" for 
exit and "en" for enter and commands and macros can be run multiple times by 
putting a number in front, eg "2 dn". See macros/* for examples.

I retain the copyright to this code but feel free to use and modify it however
you see fit so long as my original copyright message remains.
